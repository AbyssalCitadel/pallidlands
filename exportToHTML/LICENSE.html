<span class="s0">CC0 1.0 Universal</span>

    <span class="s0">CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE</span>
    <span class="s0">LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN</span>
    <span class="s0">ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS</span>
    <span class="s0">INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES</span>
    <span class="s0">REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS</span>
    <span class="s0">PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM</span>
    <span class="s0">THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED</span>
    <span class="s0">HEREUNDER.</span>

<span class="s0">Statement of Purpose</span>

<span class="s0">The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer</span>
<span class="s0">exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator</span>
<span class="s0">and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of</span>
<span class="s0">authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).</span>

<span class="s0">Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for</span>
<span class="s0">the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and</span>
<span class="s0">scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear</span>
<span class="s0">of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other</span>
<span class="s0">works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever</span>
<span class="s0">and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.</span>
<span class="s0">These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free</span>
<span class="s0">culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific</span>
<span class="s0">works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in</span>
<span class="s0">part through the use and efforts of others.</span>

<span class="s0">For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any</span>
<span class="s0">expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person</span>
<span class="s0">associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she</span>
<span class="s0">is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily</span>
<span class="s0">elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its</span>
<span class="s0">terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the</span>
<span class="s0">Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</span>

<span class="s0">1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be</span>
<span class="s0">protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and</span>
<span class="s0">Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not</span>
<span class="s0">limited to, the following:</span>

  <span class="s0">i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,</span>
     <span class="s0">communicate, and translate a Work;</span>
 <span class="s0">ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);</span>
<span class="s0">iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or</span>
     <span class="s0">likeness depicted in a Work;</span>
 <span class="s0">iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,</span>
     <span class="s0">subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;</span>
  <span class="s0">v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data</span>
     <span class="s0">in a Work;</span>
 <span class="s0">vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the</span>
     <span class="s0">European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal</span>
     <span class="s0">protection of databases, and under any national implementation</span>
     <span class="s0">thereof, including any amended or successor version of such</span>
     <span class="s0">directive); and</span>
<span class="s0">vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the</span>
     <span class="s0">world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national</span>
     <span class="s0">implementations thereof.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention</span>
<span class="s0">of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,</span>
<span class="s0">irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of</span>
<span class="s0">Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes</span>
<span class="s0">of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as</span>
<span class="s0">future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories</span>
<span class="s0">worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or</span>
<span class="s0">treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future</span>
<span class="s0">medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,</span>
<span class="s0">including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional</span>
<span class="s0">purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each</span>
<span class="s0">member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and</span>
<span class="s0">successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to</span>
<span class="s0">revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or</span>
<span class="s0">equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public</span>
<span class="s0">as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason</span>
<span class="s0">be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the</span>
<span class="s0">Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into</span>
<span class="s0">account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the</span>
<span class="s0">extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected</span>
<span class="s0">person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,</span>
<span class="s0">irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and</span>
<span class="s0">Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the</span>
<span class="s0">maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future</span>
<span class="s0">time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number</span>
<span class="s0">of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without</span>
<span class="s0">limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was</span>
<span class="s0">applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any</span>
<span class="s0">reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such</span>
<span class="s0">partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder</span>
<span class="s0">of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she</span>
<span class="s0">will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related</span>
<span class="s0">Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of</span>
<span class="s0">action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's</span>
<span class="s0">express Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</span>

 <span class="s0">a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,</span>
    <span class="s0">surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</span>
 <span class="s0">b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or</span>
    <span class="s0">warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,</span>
    <span class="s0">statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of</span>
    <span class="s0">title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non</span>
    <span class="s0">infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or</span>
    <span class="s0">the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to</span>
    <span class="s0">the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</span>
 <span class="s0">c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons</span>
    <span class="s0">that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without</span>
    <span class="s0">limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.</span>
    <span class="s0">Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary</span>
    <span class="s0">consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the</span>
    <span class="s0">Work.</span>
 <span class="s0">d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a</span>
    <span class="s0">party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to</span>
    <span class="s0">this CC0 or use of the Work.</span></pre>
